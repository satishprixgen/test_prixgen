                                  <p>Today’s Organizations have more choices than ever when choosing an enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution. From on-premises systems to cloud-based software-as-a-service to industry-based solutions, there is a dazzling array. And decision makers can feel overwhelmed when trying to determine which features and functions are the most important.</p>

                     <div class="factor_listing">

                        <h3>Undertaking requirement gathering seriously</h3>

<p>“It is very common, and very tempting, to take existing business processes as is and automate them with an ERP System”. “While conceptually this is understandable, you must take the time and make the effort to analyze those processes as part of your ERP requirements gathering. Implementing a new ERP system is an opportunity to identify and improve/redesign your business processes. Automating a bad process only makes a bad process run faster.”</p>

<h3>Must include end-users (from all departments) in the decision-making process</h3>

<p>It’s crucial to involve employees not just from IT, but across the entire organization from finance, operations, manufacturing and warehouse. Engaging stakeholders across the entire organization in every step of the decision-making process will ensure everyone is invested in finding and implementing the right solution as smoothly as possible.”</p>

 <h3>Budgeting properly for technology staff</h3>

<p>Take the time to properly budget, taking into account the talent driving the implementation, so you don’t come up against issues or surprises later.</p>

 <h3>Weighing the pros and cons of on-premises vs. cloud-based ERP</h3>

<p>With software-as-a-service fast becoming the predominate platform for new ERP implementations, SaaS may seem like the perfect solution for organizations who experienced difficult implementations or have struggled to support their earlier ERP investments.</p>

 <h3>Not including an industry-specific solution in the decision-making process</h3>

<p>When choosing an ERP solution, executives often overlook the fact that “there are a lot of very good small software companies that support specific industries with specialized needs. And these specialized vendors/solutions “may provide more industry-specific features and software customization,” which may be a better fit for your business.</p>

 <h3>Being dazzled by features</h3>

<p>Features are important, but they aren’t everything. Too often, an organization selects the ERP that has the longest features matrix.” Instead, businesses should consider the solution’s “industry success history, customization, flexibility and integration ability,” as well as customer support, in addition to how well the solution addresses the organization’s needs/requirements.</p>

 <h3>Ignoring change management</h3>

<p>Change management is an absolute requirement when implementing a new ERP solution. The ability to effectively manage change may very well be the most important skill that executives, managers and employees need to master. Business transformations through ERP will not take place without effectively managing change across three key organizational areas: people, process and technology.</p>

 <h3>Not investing in/supporting the implementation team</h3>

<p>Properly structuring the internal implementation team and giving it the necessary time and resources, it needs to carry out the implementation and associated business transformation is one of the most critical steps of an ERP project. A successful team requires the right people, with executive buy-in and decision-making power to get the job done. This often means re-assigning the day-to-day responsibilities of team members,” but doing so can be the difference between a successful rollout and failure.</p>

 <h3>Not regularly communicating information across the departments</h3>

<p>To avoid this problem, “create a project communication plan for all phases of the project. Put together “a small core team [composed of individuals from different departments] that communicates and works well with one another and that has influence in the business areas most affected by the new solution. Then make sure they are [kept] fully up-to-date on project progress at all times” and, in turn, keep all those in affected areas up to date.</p>

 <h3>Must have a maintenance plan</h3>

<p>Implementing an ERP system takes time, but the work hardly stops once the system is successfully in place. Outdated ERP systems can put companies at risk for security issues and holes in their business processes. Having a set plan and assigning who in the company is responsible for the project and maintenance at a given time will ensure the ERP system is always running smoothly and is up-to-date with the latest applications.</p>
